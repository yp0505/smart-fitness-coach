## 💼 Why This Project Matters

- 🌍 **Health Crisis**: Over 1.9B adults are overweight, with over 650M obese
- 😓 **Misinformation**: Social media is flooded with influencer “bro-science”
- 🧠 **Decision Fatigue**: People don’t know what to eat, when to rest, or how to train
- 💸 **Unaffordable coaching**: Personal trainers & nutritionists are expensive

> We’re solving this with a local-first AI system that gives you everything a fitness coach would — for free, forever.

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

Working in the healthcare industry at **Johnson & Johnson** and **Novartis**, I saw firsthand how much data we have around wellness — and how little of it is accessible or actionable for individuals. 

I’ve always been personally committed to living a healthy, balanced life — I meditate daily, practice **pranayama** (yogic breathwork), train consistently, and follow a clean diet. These habits have transformed my energy, clarity, and mental strength.

I wanted to bring that clarity and discipline to others through a **powerful, personalized AI fitness assistant** — something that combines scientific accuracy with holistic guidance.

This project is my way of merging industry-grade health intelligence with accessible tools that can actually make people’s lives better.

> **This isn’t just a project. It’s a movement.**
> Millions of people don’t need more gym selfies. They need guidance.
> This app brings that — with zero cost, infinite personalization, and zero judgment.
